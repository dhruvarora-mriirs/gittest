Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides a way to have access controlsecurity policies. This also allows a way to have Mandatory access control (MAC),
There are 3 different modes.
•  enforcing
•  permissive
•  disabled
By default you system will come with enforcing mode.  In this mode the policies will be enforced in the system, andthis should be used in every production system. In the permissive mode the policies will not be enforced but any denialis logged. The disabled mode completely disable the SELinux.
1.getenforce :The getenforce command will tell you the current SELinux mode.
2.usage:  setenforce [ Enforcing | Permissive | 1 | 0 ] :: using setenforce to set the enforcing .



File System mounting
1.Mount :If you typemountin the shell, it will tell you about various filesystems, and how are they mounted (as a directory) in the system.
 /dev/vd* For virtual machines   •  /dev/sd* For physical machines
2.sudo dnf install ntfs-3g -y ::If   you   connect   vfat   partitioned   USB   drives   (the   normal   pendrives),    they   will   auto   mount   under   the/run/media/username/directory. But, for NTFS based drives, you will have to install the driver to mount those parti-tions
3.sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt :the mount command to mount a file system on an existing directory. The syntax to do that is,mount device/path/to/mount/at.
4.unmount: the umount command on a given directory to unmount the file system


Networking Commands
1.  ip addr show : to find ip address of a system
2. ping google.com : will used to check if connected computer is responding over network.
3.cat /etc/hosts : contains list of domain name server hosts,u can update this to add a domain to any particular IP address
4.cat /etc/resolv.conf :It contains the DNS server address to use for DNS queries
5.host www.google.com :The host command will show you the IP address of any given hostname.
6.dig email.in :dig command can tell us DNS records, MX details (used to send emails) and other information for a given domainname
7.dig rtnpro.com @208.67.222.22   : if you want to specify a DNS server to use, you can do that with the address specified at the end of the command alongwith a @ sign.
8. ss -putn :ss command shows us socket statistics from the system. This command replaces the older netstat command.
9.tracerout www.google.com :traceroute command is used to show the full route of a network packet from the system to any given host.
10. tracepath www.google.com :The tracepath command traces a path to a network host discovering MTU along the path.  This is a modern replace-ment of the traceroute command.
11. ssh localhost : command to do remote login.
12.ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "da@gmail.com" :to generate new ssh key ,it helps us to securely login to othercomputers
13.ssh-copy-id fedora@209.12.123.55 :ssh-copy-id command copies the keys to a given remote system
14.How to find active (open) network connections from your com-puter? ::$ sudo lsof -i -n -P
15. sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config : we can disable password auth at remote by changing this config.


A firewall is a network security system, which can monitor and control network packets coming in and going out froma system based on pre-defined rules.In this chapter, we will learn aboutiptablescommand and how can we use the same to create and manage the system’sfirewall. The netfilter subsystem in Linux Kernel handles the actual packet filtering in the network level.

1.sudo apt install iptables-persistent 

When a network packet reaches the related table, and the related chain inside of the table, the rules gets matched fromtop to bottom. 
If the packet matches then thetargetof the rule gets executed. 
Each chain also has a default policy, if no rule matches, then, the default poilicy gets applied on the packet.
 We will learn more about these in details.
iptables has 5 built in chains.
•INPUT :for all packets incoming to the system
•OUTPUT :for all packets going out from the system
•FORWARD :for the routed packets, this is when the system works as a router
•PREROUTING :for port forwarding
•POSTROUTING :for Source Network Address Translation (SNAT), this applies to all packets leaving the sys-tem

1.iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP : make rule to stop any icmp request.
2.Flushing all rules : iptables -F
3.iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination YOUR_IP/24 --dport PORT_NUMBER -˓→j ::for debugging firewall rules.
4.iptables -t raw -A OUTPUT -p tcp --destination YOUR_IP/24 --dport PORT_NUMBER -j ::for debugging firewall rules.
5.iptables -D INPUT 4 : to delete a rule based on number.
6.iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT : delete a rule directly.
7.iptables -nvL  : to view existing rules.
Examples to add rules at port 80,22.
1.iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
2.iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
3.iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
4.iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
5.iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
6.iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT
7.iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT
8.iptables -A FORWARD -j REJECT


w: shows all user logged in to computer.
cp: copy source file into destination.
vi : command used to create files.
wc : count words in a file.
mv : renaming files.
rm : delete files.


The curl command transfers data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE).
