UNIT TESTING
Unit Testing is a one of the testing done by the developers to make sure individual unit or component functionalities are working fine.

Mockito: A framework used to mock the classes that are being used by a unit.
         We can use mockito to mock various services that are required by our unit which we are testing.
         
Assert functions :these are various assert functions to check if the expected and return values are same.

For Controllers we can use RestTemplate and MockMvc to perform various api calls.

We can use various MockMvc method to define content type we expect from api calls.

We can MockBean that are required and can injectBean into the services that required mocked beans.

Mockito verify functions can be used to check how many times a method is called and if we are getting what we expect.

To Generate Reports, There are Many ways : I have used Sure-fire

First We need to add Dependency in pom file:
 <reporting>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-report-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.19.1</version>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </reporting>
Then we need to Go To runAs then run configuration :: write name.
                                                      then at base directory select ur project from workspace.
                                                      then write at goals ::clean install test surefire-report:report
                                                      then apply and run
Now refresh your project , Report will be generated at ur target folder with a html view of report.
